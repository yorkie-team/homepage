## Getting Started with Android SDK

Let's start using Yorkie with the Android SDK. 

### Using in your projects
The library is published to Maven Central.

#### Gradle
Add a dependency to the dependencies block.

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("dev.yorkie:yorkie-android:{{NEXT_PUBLIC_YORKIE_VERSION}}")
}
```

#### Maven
Add a dependency to the \<dependencies> element.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.yorkie</groupId>
  <artifactId>yorkie-android</artifactId>
  <version>{{NEXT_PUBLIC_YORKIE_VERSION}}</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

### How to use Yorkie

#### 1. Creating a Client with API key

First, create a Client instance with API key and connect it to the yorkie server.

```kotlin
val client = Client(context, "{{API_HOST}}", {{API_PORT}}, false, Options(apiKey = "xxxxx"))

// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.activateAsync().await	
}
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### 2. Creating a Document

Then create a Document.

```kotlin
val document = Document(Key("doc-1"))

// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.attachAsync(document).await()
}
```

The created document should be attached to the client to automatically synchronize the document between the client and peers.

#### 3. Updating the Document

The created document is initially an empty object. You can create or update a key-value property you would like to share with peers using `Document.updateAsync()`.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.updateAsync { root ->
    root["key"] = "value" // {"key":"value"}
  }.await()
}
```

#### 4. Accessing Document

If you want to access the document properties, you can use `Document.getRoot()`.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.updateAsync { root ->
    root["sharedMessage"] = "Hello World!" // {"sharedMessage":"Hello World!"}
  }.await()
  println(document.getRoot()["sharedMessage"]) // "Hello World!"
}
```

#### 5. Subscribing to the changes that happen in the Document

Clients sharing the same document can subscribe to the changes that happen in the Document.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.collect { event ->
    println("A change event occured in the Document!")
  }
}
```

You can execute different actions depending on the source of change. 

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.collect { event ->
    if (event is Document.Event.RemoteChange) {
      println("A peer has changed the Document!")
    }
  }
}
```

To create a collaborative application, it is important to be able to access certain document properties when a specific property in the document is modified. By examining the `paths`, you can determine which property has been changed and perform different actions based on that information. 

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.collect { event ->
    if (event is Document.Event.RemoteChange) {
      event.changeInfos.forEach { changeInfo ->
        changeInfo.paths.forEach { path ->
          if (path.startsWith("$.sharedMessage")) {
            println("One of your peers has changed the message to ${document.getRoot()["sharedMessage"]}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. Viewing the presence of other peers

Other peers' activities can be accessed by subscribing to the client.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.peerStatus.collect { peers ->
    println("There are currently ${peers.size} peers")
  }
}
```

Next, let's take a look at the [Android SDK](/docs/android-sdk).
