## iOS SDK

Through Yorkie iOS SDK, you can efficiently build collaborative applications. On the client-side implementation, you can create Documents that are automatically synced with remote peers with minimal effort.

If you want to install the SDK, refer to the [Getting Started with iOS SDK](/docs/getting-started/with-ios-sdk).

### Client

`Client` is a normal client that can communicate with the server. It has Documents and sends changes of the Document from local to the server to synchronize with other replicas in remote.

#### Creating a Client

We can create a Client using `Client(rpcAddress: RPCAddress(host:,port:), options:)`. After the Client has been activated, it is connected to the server and ready to use.

```swift
let client = Client(rpcAddress: RPCAddress(host: "{{API_HOST}}", port: {{API_PORT}}), options: ClientOptions(
    apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
))
try await client.activate()
```

#### Subscribing to Client events

We can use `client.eventStream` to subscribe to client-based events, such as `status-changed`, `stream-connection-status-changed` and `peer-changed`.

```swift
target.eventStream.sink { event in
    switch event.type {
    case .statusChanged:
        ()
    case .streamConnectionStatusChanged:
        ()
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

By using the value of the `stream-connection-status-changed` event, it is possible to determine whether the Client is connected to the network.

If you want to know about other ClientEvents, please refer to the [ClientEventType](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-ios-sdk/documentation/yorkie/clienteventtype).

#### Presence

Presence is a feature that allows you to display information about users who are currently using a collaborative application. Presence is often used in collaborative applications such as document editors, chat apps, and other real-time applications.

```swift
var optionA = ClientOptions()
optionA.presence = ["username": "alice", "color": "blue"]

let clientA = Client(rpcAddress: rpcAddress, options: optionA)
try await clientA.activate()

let docA = Document(key: "doc-1")
try await clientA.attach(docA)
```

Then, another Client is created and attaches a Document with the same name as before.

```swift
var optionB = ClientOptions()
optionB.presence = ["username": "alice", "color": "blue"]

let clientB = Client(rpcAddress: rpcAddress, options: optionA)
try await clientB.activate()

let docB = Document(key: "doc-1")
try await clientB.attach(docB)
```

When a new peer registers or leaves, the `peers-changed` event is fired, and the other peer's clientID and presence can be obtained from the event.

```swift
clientA.eventStream.sink { event in
    if let event = event as? PeerChangedEvent {
        let peers = event.value.peers["doc-1"]
        switch event.value.type {
        case .initialized:
            displayPeers(peers)
        case .watched:
            peers.forEach { addPeer($0) }
            // peer as follows:
            // {
            //   clientID: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            //   presence: ["username": "bob", "color": "red"]
            // }
        case .unwatched:
            peers.forEach { removePeer($0) }
        case .presenceChanged:
            peers.forEach { updatePeer($0) }
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, `clientA` receives a `watched` event from `clientB` because `clientB` attached the Document with the key `doc-1`.

Presence can include their names, colors, and other identifying details.

### Document

`Document` is a primary data type in Yorkie, which provides a JSON-like updating experience that makes it easy to represent your application's model. A `Document` can be updated without being attached to the client, and its changes are automatically propagated to other peers when the `Document` is attached to the `Client` or when the network is restored.

#### Creating a Document

We can create a Document using `Document(key: "doc-key")`. Let's create a Document with a key and attach it to the Client.

```swift
let doc = Document(key: docKey)
try await client.attach(doc);
```

> The document key is used to identify the Document in Yorkie. It is a string that can be freely defined by the user. However, it is allowed to use only `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, `~` and must be less than 120 characters.

After attaching the Document to the Client, all changes to the Document are automatically synchronized with remote peers.

#### Changing Syncronization Mode

If you want to change syncronization mode, you can use `client.pause(doc)` and `client.resume(doc)`.

```swift
// Pause real-time sync.
await client.pause(doc);

// Resume real-time sync.
await client.resume(doc);
```

#### Editing the Document

`Document.update(:,message:)` enables you to modify a Document. The optional `message` allows you to add a description to the change. If the Document is attached to the Client, all changes are automatically synchronized with other Clients.

```swift
let message = "update document for test";
try await doc.update({ root in
  root.obj = [:]                      // {"obj":{}}
  let obj = root.obj as! JSONObject
  obj.num = Int64(1)                  // {"obj":{"num":1}}
  obj.obj = ["str": "a"]              // {"obj":{"num":1,"obj":{"str":"a"}}}
  obj.arr = [Int64(1), Int64(2)]      // {"obj":{"num":1,"obj":{"str":"a"},"arr":[1,2]}}
}, message: message);
```

Under the hood, `root` in the `update` function creates a `change`, a set of operations, using a JavaScript proxy. Every element has its unique ID, created by the logical clock. This ID is used by Yorkie to track which object is which.

You can get the contents of the Document using `doc.getRoot()`.

```swift
let root = doc.getRoot()
print(root.obj!) // {"num":1,"obj":{"str":"a"},"arr":[1,2]}
let obj = root.obj as! JSONObject
print(obj.num!)  // 1
print(obj.obj!)  // {"str":"a"}
print(obj.arr!)  // [1,2]
```

#### Subscribing to Document events

A Document is modified by changes generated remotely or locally in Yorkie. When the Document is modified, change events occur, to which we can subscribe using `document.subscribe`. Here, we can do post-processing such as repaint in the application using the `path` of the change events.

```swift
await target.eventStream.sink { event in
    switch event {
    case let event as LocalChangeEvent:
        print(event)
    case let event as RemoteChangeEvent:
        for changeInfo in event.value {
            print(changeInfo.change.message)
            for path in changeInfo.paths {
                if path.starts(with: "$.obj.num") {
                    // root.obj.num is changed
                } else if path.starts(with: "$.obj") {
                    // root.obj is changed
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Detaching the Document

If the document is no longer used, it should be detached to increase the efficiency of GC removing [CRDT tombstones](https://crdt.tech/glossary). For more information about GC, please refer to [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/garbage-collection.md).

```swift
try await client.detach(doc)
```

### Custom CRDT types

Custom CRDT types are data types that can be used for special applications such as text editors and counters, unlike general JSON data types such as `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`. Custom CRDT types can be created in the callback function of `document.update`.

#### JSONText

`JSONText` provides supports for collaborative text editing. `JSONText` has selection information for sharing the cursor position. In addition, contents in `Text` can have attributes; for example, characters can be bold, italic, or underlined.

```swift
try await doc.update{ root in
    root.text = JSONText() // {"text":[]}
    (root.text as? JSONText)?.edit(0, 0, "hello")               // {"text":[{"val":"hello"}]}
    (root.text as? JSONText)?.edit(0, 1, "H")                   // {"text":[{"val":"H"},{"val":"ello"}]}
    (root.text as? JSONText)?.select(0, 1)
    (root.text as? JSONText)?.setStyle(fromIdx: 0, toIdx: 1, attributes: ["bold": true])    // {"text":[{"attrs":{"bold":"true"},"val":"H"},{"val":"ello"}]}
}
```

#### JSONCounter

`JSONCounter` supports integer types changing with addition and subtraction. If an integer data needs to be modified simultaneously, `JSONCounter` should be used instead of primitives.

```swift
try await doc.update{ root in
    root.counter = JSONCounter(value: Int64(1))                 // {"counter":1}
    (root.counter as? JSONCounter<Int64>)?.increase(value: 2)   // {"counter":3}
    (root.counter as? JSONCounter<Int64>)?.increase(value: 3)   // {"counter":6}
    (root.counter as? JSONCounter<Int64>)?.increase(value: -4)  // {"counter":2}
}
```
