## Internals

This section goes over some of the internals of Yorkie, such as the CRDT, ordering of messages via Lamport clocks, etc.

<Alert status="warning">Because this section explains internals for understanding the techniques, It is not essential for using Yorkie.</Alert>

### Garbage Collection

One of the most important issues in CRDT systems is handling tombstones. Tombstones are used to properly synchronize the document even when remote peer's operations refer to the elements that have already been locally deleted. This causes the problem that the document keeps growing even if elements are deleted.

Yorkie provides Garbage Collection to solve this problem.

#### How it works

Garbage collection checks that deleted nodes are no longer referenced remotely and purges them completely.

Server records the logical timestamp of the last change pulled by the client whenever the client requests PushPull. And Server returns the smallest logical timestamp, `min_synced_seq` of all clients in response PushPull to the client. `min_synced_seq` is used to check whether deleted nodes are no longer to be referenced remotely or not.

An example of garbage collection:

#### State 1

<Image
  alt="state1"
  src="/assets/images/docs/garbage-collection-1.png"
  width={600}
  height={312}
  style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
/>

In the initial state, both clients have `"ab"`.

#### State 2

<Image
  alt="state2"
  src="/assets/images/docs/garbage-collection-2.png"
  width={600}
  height={318}
  style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
/>

Client `c1` deletes `"b"`, which is recorded as a change with logical timestamp `3`. The text node of `"b"` can be referenced
by remote, so it is only marked as tombstone. And the client `c1` sends change `3` to server through PushPull API and receives
as a response that `min_synced_seq` is `2`. Since all clients did not receive the deletion `change 3`, the text node is not
purged by garbage collection.

Meanwhile, client `c2` inserts `"c"` after textnode `"b"`.

#### State 3

<Image
  alt="state3"
  src="/assets/images/docs/garbage-collection-3.png"
  width={600}
  height={317}
  style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
/>

Client `c2` pushes change `4` to server and receives as a response that `min_synced_seq` is `3`. After the client applies change `4`, the contents of document are changed to `ac`. This time, all clients have received change `3`, so textnode `"b"` is completely removed.

#### State 4

<Image
  alt="state4"
  src="/assets/images/docs/garbage-collection-4.png"
  width={600}
  height={302}
  style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
/>

Finally, after client `c1` receives change `4` from server, purges textnode `"b"` because it is no longer referenced remotely.
