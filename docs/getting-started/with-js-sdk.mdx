## Getting Started with JS SDK

Let's start using Yorkie with the JS SDK. You need an environment that can run JavaScript, such as a browser.

### Installation

To use the Yorkie JavaScript SDK in your project, you will need to install it using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yorkie-js-sdk):

```bash
$ npm install yorkie-js-sdk
```

or just include the following code in the `<head>` tag of your HTML:

```html
<!-- include yorkie js -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/yorkie-js-sdk/{{YORKIE_JS_VERSION}}/yorkie-js-sdk.js"></script>
```

> The JS SDKs are also provided by [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com) to make loading library files faster and easier on websites.<br/>For more the JS SDKs: [https://cdnjs.com/libraries/yorkie-js-sdk](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/yorkie-js-sdk)

### How to use Yorkie

#### 1. Creating a Client with API key

First, create a Client with API key.

```js
async function main() {
  // 01. create a new client instance and connect to the yorkie server.
  const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
    apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  });
  await client.activate();

  // ...
}
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### 2. Creating a Document

Then create a Document.

```js
// 02. create a new document and attach it to the client
const doc = new yorkie.Document('my-doc');
await client.attach(doc);
```

The created document should be attached to the client to automatically synchronize the document between the client and peers.

#### 3. Updating the Document

The created document is initially an empty object. You can create or update a key-value property you would like to share with peers using `doc.update()`.

```js
doc.update((root) => {
  root['key'] = 'value'; // {"key":"value"}
});
```

#### 4. Accessing Document

If you want to access the document properties, you can use `doc.getRoot()`. Using a dot notation, you can access a key-value property you or your peers have set.

```js
doc.update((root) => {
  root.sharedMessage = 'Hello World!';
});
console.log(doc.getRoot().sharedMessage); // "Hello World!";
```

#### 5. Subscribing to the changes that happen in the Document

Clients sharing the same document can subscribe to the changes that happen in the Document using `doc.subscribe()`

```js
doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log('A change event occurred in the Document!');
});
```

You can execute different actions depending on the source of change. The source can be accessed from `event.type`.

```js
doc.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === 'remote-change') {
    console.log('A peer has changed the Document!');
  }
});
```

Accessing certain document properties when a specific property in the document is changed is the key to creating a collaborative application. You can perform different actions based on which property has changed in the document by examining `paths` array that exists in `event.value` array.

```js
doc.subscribe((event) => {
 if (event.type === 'remote-change') {
    for (const changeInfo of event.value) {
      for (const path of changeInfo.paths) {
        if (path.startsWith('$.sharedMessage') {
          console.log(`One of your peers has changed the message to ${doc.getRoot().sharedMessage}`)
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

#### 6. Viewing the presence of other peers

Other peers' activities can be accessed by subscribing to the client.

```js
client.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === 'peers-changed') {
    const peers = event.value[doc.getKey()];
    const peersCount = Object.entries(peers).length;
    console.log(`There are currently ${peersCount} peers`);
  }
});
```

Next, let's take a look at the [JS SDK](/docs/js-sdk).
