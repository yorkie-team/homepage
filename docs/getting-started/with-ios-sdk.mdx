## Getting Started with iOS SDK

Welcome to Yorkie iOS SDK! In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to get started with the iOS SDK.

### Using in your projects

#### Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Yorkie as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```
dependencies: [
  .Package(url: "https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-ios-sdk.git", from: "{{YORKIE_IOS_VERSION}}")
]
```

### How to use Yorkie

#### 1. Creating a Client with API key

First, create a Client with API key

```swift
let client = Client(rpcAddress: RPCAddress(host: "{{API_HOST}}", port: {{API_PORT}}), options: ClientOptions(key: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"))
try await client.activate()
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### 2. Creating a Document

Then create a Document.

```swift
let doc = Document(key: docKey)
try await client.attach(doc);
```

The created document should be attached to the client to automatically synchronize the document between the client and peers.

#### 3. Updating the Document

The created document is initially an empty object. You can create or update a key-value property you would like to share with peers using `Document.update()`.

```swift
try await doc.update { root in
  root.key = "Key value"
}
```

#### 4. Accessing Document

If you want to access the document properties, you can use `Document.getRoot().get()`.

```swift
let value = await doc.getRoot().get("key") as? String
```

#### 5. Subscribing to the changes that happen in the Document

Clients sharing the same document can subscribe to the changes that happen in the Document using `doc.subscribe()`.

```swift
await doc.subscribe { event in
  print("A change event occurred in the Document!")
}
```

You can execute different actions depending on the source of change. The source can be accessed from `event.type`.

The value can be: `localChange`, `remoteChange` or `snapshot`.

```swift
await doc.subscribe { event in
  if event.type == .remoteChange {
    print("A peer has changed the Document!")
  }
}
```

To subscribe to changes for a specific path in the document, you can use the `doc.subscribe(targetPath, callback)` with a path argument, such as `$.todos`, where the `$` sign indicates the root of the document.
The callback function is called when the target path and its nested values are changed.

With this feature, you can easily subscribe to changes for a specific part of the document and perform different actions based on the updated values.

```swift
await doc.subscribe(targetPath: "$.todos") { event in 
  // The callback will be called when the root.todos or its nested values change.
  Task {
    let target = try? await target.getValueByPath(path: "$.todos") // You can get the value by path.
  }
  // Do something...
}
```

#### 6. Viewing the presence of other peers

Other peers' activities can be accessed by subscribing to the client.

```swift
client.eventStream.sink { event in
    switch event {
    case let event as PeerChangedEvent:
        print("#### c1 \(event)")
    default:
        break
    }
}.store(in: &self.cancellables)
```

Next, let's take a look at the [iOS SDK](/docs/ios-sdk).
