## Project

Project represents your service or application in Yorkie. Separate Projects can exist within a single application. You can add more Projects as needed, for example, if you want to manage [auth webhook](/docs/project#auth-webhook) and documents for specific purposes.

To manage Projects, you can use the `project` subcommand:

```bash
$ yorkie project
Manage projects

Usage:
  yorkie project [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create a new project
  ls          List all projects
  update      Update a project

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for project

Use "yorkie project [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Listing Projects

You can list Projects on the server using `ls`.

```bash
$ yorkie project ls
 NAME     PUBLIC KEY            SECRET KEY            AUTH WEBHOOK URL  AUTH WEBHOOK METHODS  CREATED AT
 default  caes5i3hkdftdruae2tg  caes5i3hkdftdruae2u0                    []                    2 minutes
```

_Server creates a `default project` automatically. If you create a Client without apiKey, the Client is created in the default Project._

### Creating a Project

You can create a new Project with a name using `create`.

```bash
$ yorkie project create test-project
{"id":"627c9125d02654d3f0f769d8","name":"test-project","public_key":"c9u9298qp9as73b8i190","secret_key":"c9u9298qp9as73b8i19g","auth_webhook_url":"","auth_webhook_methods":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T04:46:29.781052056Z"}
```

If you create a Client with `public_key` of the Project as `apiKey`, you can manage the Client in the Project.

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('localhost:8080', {
  apiKey: 'c9u9298qp9as73b8i190', // public_key of the project
});
```

Then Documents attached to the Client are isolated and stored in the Project.

### Updating the Project

You can update the Project on the server using `update`.

```
Usage:
  yorkie project update [name] [flags]

Examples:
yorkie project update name [options]

Flags:
      --auth-webhook-url string   authorization-webhook update url
  -h, --help                      help for update
      --name string               new project name
```

You can update the name of the Project with `--name` flag.

```bash
$ yorkie project update test-project --name new-test-project
{"id":"627c9125d02654d3f0f769d8","name":"new-test-project","auth_webhook_url":"http://localhost:3000/webhook","auth_webhook_methods":["AttachDocument","WatchDocuments"],"public_key":"cblt65lcefodjh0aeakg","secret_key":"cblt65lcefodjh0aeal0","created_at":"2022-05-12T04:46:29.781052056Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T14:58:22.11Z"}
```

### Auth Webhook

A webhook is an HTTP POST that is called when something happens. If the Auth Webhook has been configured, when a Server receives a request from a Client, the Server checks if the Client has been authorized for a certain Document by asking an outside service with a REST request.

This page shows how to set up an Auth Webhook. The overall flow is as follows:

```
(5) response the request  (4) handle the request
     ┌─────────────────┐  ┌──┐
     │                 │  │  │   (3) response
     ▼                 │  ▼  │    - allowed
 ┌──────┐             ┌┴─────┤    - reason   ┌──────────────┐
 │Client├────────────►│Server│◄──────────────┤Outside Server│
 └──────┘ (1)request  └────┬─┘               └──────────────┘
           - token         │                      ▲
           - dockey        └──────────────────────┘
                               (2) call webhook
                                - token
                                - dockey
                                - verb: r or rw
```

First, We need to pass some tokens (that identify users in the service) when creating a Client:

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('localhost:8080', {
  token: SOME_TOKEN,
});
```

This token will be sent to the Server upon every request from the Client.

We can specify an Auth Webhook for the project by update command with the `--auth-webhook-url` flag:

```bash
$ yorkie project update [name] --auth-webhook-url http://localhost:3000/auth-hook
```

The Server who receives the token calls the given webhook URL before processing the requests.

Here is an example of the webhook requests:

```javascript
{
  "token": "SOME_TOKEN",          // token passed by the client
  "method": "PushPull",           // method: ActivateClient, DeactivateClient, AttachDocument, DetachDocument, WatchDocuments
  documentAttributes: [{
    key: "DOCUMENT_KEY",          // document key
    verb: "r"                     // 'r' or 'rw'
  }]
}
```

The outside server should respond like this:

```javascript
{
  "allowed": true, // or false if the given token is not authorized for this document.
  "reason": "ok"   // [optional] reason for this response.
}
```

If the server receives a response with `allowed: true` from the outside server, it handles the request normally, otherwise it sends the `codes.Unauthenticated` error to the client.
