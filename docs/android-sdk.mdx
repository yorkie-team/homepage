## Android SDK

Through Yorkie Android SDK, you can efficiently build collaborative applications. On the client-side implementation, you can create Documents that are automatically synced with remote peers with minimal effort.

If you want to install the SDK, refer to the [Getting Started with Android SDK](/docs/getting-started/with-android-sdk).

### Client

`Client` is a normal client that can communicate with the server. It has Documents and sends changes of the Document from local to the server to synchronize with other replicas in remote.

#### Creating a Client

We can create a Client using `Client(context: Context, rpcHost: String, rpcPort: Int, usePlainText: Boolean, options: Options)`. After the Client has been activated, it is connected to the server and ready to use.

```kotlin
val client = Client(context, "{{API_HOST}}", {{API_PORT}}, Options(apiKey = "xxxxx"), false)
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.activateAsync().await	
}
```
> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).
<br /><br />
> usePlainText should be set false unless you use it for testing. For more information, please refer to [usePlainText](https://grpc.github.io/grpc-java/javadoc/io/grpc/ManagedChannelBuilder.html#usePlaintext--).


#### Subscribing to Client events

We can use `client.events` to subscribe to client based events, such as `status`, `streamConnectionStatus`, and `peerStatus`. 

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.status.collect {
    println(it) // "Activated" or "Deactivated"
  }
}

scope.launch {
  client.streamConnectionStatus.collect {
    println(it) // "Connected" or "Disconnected"
  }
}
```
By using the value of the `streamConnectionStatus`, it is possible to determine whether the Client is connected to the network.

If you want to know about other client events, please refer to [Client.Event](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-android-sdk/yorkie/dev.yorkie.core/-client/-event/index.html).

### Document

`Document` is a primary data type in Yorkie, which provides a JSON-like updating experience that makes it easy to represent your application's model.
A `Document` can be updated without being attached to the client, and its changes are automatically propagated to other clients when the `Document` is attached to the `Client` or when the network is restored.

#### Creating a Document

We can create a Document using `Document()`. Let's create a Document with a key and attach it to the Client.

```kotlin
val document = Document(Document.Key("doc-1"))
```

> The document key is used to identify the Document in Yorkie. It is a string that can be freely defined by the user.
 > However, it is allowed to use only `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, `~` and must be less than 120 characters.


#### Attaching the document

When you attach, the client notifies the server that it is subscribing to this document.
If the document does not exist on the server, it will be created, and any local changes that occurred will be updated to the server's document.
If the server already has a document associated with the provided key, it sends the existing changes to the client, which are then applied to synchronize the document.

Once attached, the document becomes synchronized with other clients.
This ensures that any modifications made by one client are instantly propagated to other clients collaborating on the same document.

 The second argument is options.
 - `initialPresence`: Sets the initial presence of the client that attaches the document. The presence is shared with other users participating in the document. It must be serializable to JSON.
 - `isRealtimeSync`(Optional): Specifies whether to enable real-time synchronization. The default value is `true`, which means synchronization occurs automatically. If set to `false`, you should manually control the synchronization.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.attachAsync(
    document,
    initialPresences = mapOf("name" to "a"),
    isRealtimeSync = true,
  )
}
```

#### Updating presesnce

The `Document.update()` method allows you to make changes to the state of the current user's presence.

Specific properties provided will be changed. The existing presence object will be updated by merging the new changes. In other words, properties not specified in the update function will remain unchanged. 

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.updateAsync { _, presence ->
    presence.put(mapOf("name" to "b"))
  }.await()
}
// final state
// presence = { "name": "b" }
// we can see that the changes made were merged and the final state of the current user's presence is as we desire
```
<Alert status="warning">
Note, the properties provided will be replaced entirely and not merely updated.

For example:
```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.attachAsync(
  	document,
    initialPresences = mapOf("name" to "a")
  ).await()

  document.updateAsync { _, presence ->
    presence.put(mapOf("age" to "10"))
  }.await()
}

// final state
// presence = { "age": "10" }
// we can see that the changes made were merged and the final state of the current user's presence is as we desire
```
</Alert>

#### Getting Presence

##### Document.presences

It returns `StateFlow` emitting all the clients currently particiting in the document and their presences.

```kotlin
document.presences.value.forEach { (clientID, presence) ->
	// Do something
}
```

##### Document.Event.PresenceChange

It includes all the presence-related events.
By subscribing to it, you can be notified when specific changes occur within the document, such as clients attaching, detaching, or modifying their presence.

```Kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.events.filterIsInstance<PresenceChange>().collect { event ->
    when (event) {
      is MyPresence.Initialized -> { // users currently participating in the document }
      is Others.Watched -> { // a user has joined the document editing in online }
      is Others.Unwatched -> { // a user has left the document editing }
      is Others.PresenceChanged -> { // a user has updated the presence }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also subscribe to specific types of presence changes.

- `document.event.filterIsInstance<PresenceChange.MyPresnece>`: `Initialized`, `PresenceChanged`
- `document.event.filterIsInstance<PresenceChange.Others>`: `Watched`, `Unwatched`, `PresenceChanged`

#### Editing the Document

`Document.updateAsync(message, updater)` enables you to modify a Document. The optional `message` allows you to add a description to the change. If the Document is attached to the Client, all changes are automatically synchronized with other Clients.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  val message = "update document for test"
  document.updateAsync(message) { root ->
    root.setNewObject("obj")                                       // {"obj":{}}
    root.getAs<JsonObject>("obj")["num"] = 1                       // {"obj":{"num":1}}
    root.getAs<JsonObject>("obj").setNewObject("obj")["str"] = "a" // {"obj":{"num":1,"obj":{"str":"a"}}}
    root.getAs<JsonObject>("obj").setNewArray("arr").apply {       // {"obj":{"num":1,"obj":{"str":"a"},"arr":[1,2]}}
      put(1)
      put(2)
    } 
  }.await()
}
```

Under the hood, `root` in the `update` function creates a `change`, a set of operations, using a JavaScript proxy. Every element has its unique ID, created by the logical clock. This ID is used by Yorkie to track which object is which.

You can get the contents of the Document using `document.getRoot()`.

```kotlin
val root = document.getRoot()
println(root["obj"])                          // {"num":1,"obj":{"str":"a"},"arr":[1,2]}
println(root.getAs<JsonObject>("obj")["num"]) // 1
println(root.getAs<JsonObject>("obj")["obj"]) // {"str":"a"}
println(root.getAs<JsonObject>("obj")["arr"]) // [1,2]
```

#### Subscribing to Document

A Document can be modified by changes generated remotely or locally in Yorkie.

Whenever the Document is modified, change events are triggered and we can subscribe to these events using the `document.events`.

The events are triggered with an event object, and the event type indicates the source of the change, which can be one of the following values: `LocalChange`, `RemoteChange`, or `Snapshot`.

When the type of the event is `LocalChange` or `RemoteChange`, it has `ChangeInfo` as value.

For more information about changeInfo for document events, please refer to the [ChangeInfo](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-android-sdk/yorkie/dev.yorkie.document/-document/-event/-change-info/index.html).

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.events.collect { event ->
    if (event is Document.Event.LocalChange) {
      println(event)
    } else if (event is Document.Event.RemoteChange) {
      event.changeInfo.operations.forEach { op ->
        when (op) {
          is OperationInfo.IncreaseOpInfo -> { // Do something... }
          else -> { return@collect }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, you can subscribe to changes for a specific path in the Document using `document.events(path)` with a path argument, such as `$.todos`, where the `$` sign indicates the root of the document.
The events are delivered when the target path and its nested values are changed.

With this feature, you can easily subscribe to changes for a specific part of the document and perform different actions based on the updated values.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.events("$.todos").collect { event ->
    // Events will be delivered when the root.todos or its nested values change.
    val target = document.getValueByPath("$.todos")
    // Do something...
  }

```

#### Changing Synchronization Setting

To change the synchronization setting for a document, you can use `Client.pause(document)` and `Client.resume(document)`.

When you pause a document, the synchronization process will no longer occur in realtime, and you will need to manually execute the synchronization to ensure that the changes are propagated to other clients.

To resume the realtime synchronization, you can call `Client.resume(document)`.

```kotlin
// Pause real-time sync
client.pause(document)

// Resume real-time sync
client.resume(document)

```

#### Changing Synchronization Mode

By default, Yorkie synchronizes a document in `PushPull` mode, where local changes are pushed to the server, and remote changes are pulled from the server.

If you only want to send your changes and not receive remote changes, you can use `PushOnly` mode.

For realtime synchronization, you can use `Client.pauseRemoteChanges(document)` and `Client.resumeRemoteChanges(document)`.

For manual synchronization, you can pass the desired sync mode to `Client.syncAsync(document, syncMode)`.

```kotlin
 // Pause remote changes for realtime sync
 client.pauseRemoteChanges(document);
 // Resume remote changes for realtime sync
 client.resumeRemoteChanges(document);

 // Declare your own CoroutineScope
 scope.launch {
   // Manual sync in Push-Only mode
   client.syncAsync(doc, SyncMode.PushOnly).await();
   // Manual sync in Push-Pull mode
   client.syncAsync(doc, SyncMode.PushPull).await();
 }
 ```

#### Detaching the Document

If the document is no longer used, it should be detached to increase the efficiency of GC removing [CRDT tombstones](https://crdt.tech/glossary). For more information about GC, please refer to [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/garbage-collection.md).

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.detachAsync(document).await()
}
```

### Custom CRDT types

Custom CRDT types are data types that can be used for special applications such as text editors and counters, unlike general JSON data types such as `JsonObject` and `JsonArray`. Custom CRDT types can be created in the callback function of `document.update`.

#### JsonText
`JsonText` provides supports for collaborative text editing. In addition, contents in `JsonText` can have attributes; for example, characters can be bold, italic, or underlined.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  target.updateAsync { root ->
    root.setNewText("text")                                           // {"text":[]}
    root.getAs<JsonText>("text").edit(0, 0, "hello")                  // {"text":["val":"hello"]}
    root.getAs<JsonText>("text").edit(0, 1, "H")                      // {"text":[{"val":"H"},{"val":"ello"}]}
    root.getAs<JsonText>("text").select(0, 1)
    root.getAs<JsonText>("text").style(0, 1, mapOf("bold" to "true")) // {"text":[{"attrs":{"bold":"true"},"val":"H"},{"val":"ello"}]}
  }.await()
}
```

#### Selection using presence

The temporary client information, such as text selection, does not need to be stored in the document permanently.
Instead, it can be effectively shared using `presence`.

When transmitting text selection information, it is essential to convert the `index`, which can vary based on the text state, into the `position` used by `JsonText`.
This converted position selection can then be sent and applied through presence.

Here is an example where presence is used to share text selection between users in CodeMirror editor.

- When the text selection is changed:
```kotlin
document.updateAsync { root, presence ->
  val text = root.getAs<JsonText>("content")
  val indexRange = text.edit(from, to, content)
  val posRange = text.indexRangeToPosRange(range)
  presence.put(mapOf("selection" to gson.toJson(posRange))) // Serialize posRange as a JSON string
}
```

- When applying other user's selection changes:
```kotlin
document.events.filterIsInstance<Others>().collect { event ->
  if (event is Others.PresenceChanged) {
    val (clientID, presence) = event.changed
    val range = document.getRoot().getAs<JsonText>("content").posRangeToIndexRange(presence["selection"])
    // handle the updated selection in the editor
  }
}
```

Text selection can be efficiently shared using presence.
Please refer to the following example for a complete code:

An example of Text Editor: [Text Editor example](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-android-sdk/tree/main/examples/texteditor)


#### JsonCounter

`JsonCounter` supports integer types changing with addition and subtraction. If an integer data needs to be modified simultaneously, `JsonCounter` should be used instead of primitives.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  target.updateAsync { root ->
    root.setNewCounter("counter", 1)                // {"counter":1}
    root.getAs<JsonCounter>("counter").increase(3)  // {"counter":4}
    root.getAs<JsonCounter>("counter").increase(6)  // {"counter":10}
    root.getAs<JsonCounter>("counter").increase(-3) // {"counter":7}
  }.await()
}
```
